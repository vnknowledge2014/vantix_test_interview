# Palindrome String

Check a string input is palindrome

For example:

input: "121"
output: "true"

input: "-121"
output: "false"

## Requirements

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by changing `xit` to
`it`.
